## First Deal Structure Template

### Recommended: "Validation Pilot with Expansion Option"

| Element | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Duration | 6-9 months | Long enough for validation, short enough for urgency |
| Price Point | $150K-$350K | Below $500K discretionary threshold |
| Scope | 2-3 programs, 50-100 compounds | Enough volume to demonstrate throughput |
| Deliverables | Ranked safety profiles + wet lab comparison | Concrete validation artifact |
| Success Criteria | 3-5 prospective predictions validated | The "wow moment" |

**Payment structure:**
- 50% upfront ($75K-$175K)
- 25% at interim milestone
- 25% at completion + retrospective accuracy

## Pricing Architecture

### Lead with: Hybrid "Reserve + Usage" Model

**Don't do:**
- Pure per-compound (commoditizes immediately)
- Pure subscription (pharma hates paying for idle)
- Pure outcome-based (attribution fights kill deals)

**Do this:**

```
SYNTHYRA Safety Screen - Pilot Pricing

Base Platform Access:     $100,000 / 6 months
├── Includes: 100 compound-program credits
├── Data integration support
└── Dedicated technical contact

Additional Usage:         $500-$1,000 / compound-program
├── Tiered: $750 base, drops to $500 at 200+

Success Bonus (Optional): $25,000-$50,000
├── Triggered if prediction accuracy >80%
└── Frames outcome alignment without attribution risk
```

## Value Quantification Framework

**Don't claim counterfactuals. Frame value as:**

### 1. Time Value (Easiest to Defend)
- Wet lab safety screen: 4-8 weeks per compound
- SYNTHYRA screen: <1 week per compound
- Program acceleration: 2-6 months
- Value: $1-5M per month of acceleration

### 2. Resource Value (Moderate Defense)
- Wet lab safety panel: $50K-$150K per compound
- SYNTHYRA screen: $500-$1,000 per compound
- Frame: "We're a pre-filter. Don't spend $7M in wet lab on obvious fails."

### 3. Failure Avoidance (Hardest to Prove)
- Phase I failure cost: $10-50M + 12-18 months
- DON'T claim: "We prevented your failure"
- DO claim: "We identified [X] off-target risks your panel missed"
- Let them connect the dots

### The Sales Conversation

> "We'll screen 100 compounds. You pick 5 that passed your internal tox screen. We predict at least 2 will have off-target risks you missed. If we're wrong, no success bonus. If we're right, you'll want to expand."

## Critical Deal Terms

| Term | Push For | Accept | Walk Away |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Case study rights | Named, quotable | Anonymous with approval | No reference |
| Publication | Joint pub | Acknowledgment | Complete embargo |
| Data generated | Retain anonymized | Limited with approval | They own all |
| Expansion option | Pre-negotiated rates | Right to negotiate | Must re-compete |
| Exclusivity | None | Therapeutic area, 6 mo | Broad exclusivity |

### Non-Negotiables
1. Case study rights (if you can't tell anyone, it's worth 50% less)
2. Validation data access (your model improvement fuel)
3. Clear champion relationship

## Pilot → Expansion Path

```
PILOT ($150K-$350K)          →    EXPANSION ($500K-$1.5M/yr)
├── 1-2 programs                  ├── 5-10 programs
├── 50-100 compounds              ├── 500-1000+ compounds
├── Safety/Tox only               ├── + Target ID, Lead Opt
└── Vendor relationship           └── Preferred Platform

TRIGGER MECHANISMS (build into contract):
1. "If accuracy >80%, expansion pricing locked at 15% discount"
2. "Pilot covers Oncology. Expansion option covers Immunology, CNS"
3. "If pilot delivers 30 days early, one additional program free"
```

## Pricing Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Pricing too low | Signals lack of confidence | Price at 70-80% of value |
| Full outcome-based | Attribution fights, volatility | Hybrid with optional bonus |
| Per-seat SaaS | Commoditizes platform | Per-program or per-compound |
| Long pilot sales cycles | Defeats purpose | If >90 days, re-qualify |
| Giving away data rights | Kills model improvement | Anonymized retention minimum |
| Exclusivity for validation | Need multiple proof points | Time-limited, narrow scope |

## 12-Month Revenue Path

**Months 1-3:** Sign 1-2 pilots at $150K-$300K each
**Months 4-6:** Deliver first results, establish validation
**Months 7-9:** Convert one pilot to expansion ($500K+)
**Months 10-12:** Use case studies to close 1-2 new pilots

**12-month revenue target:** $500K-$1.2M
**12-month relationship target:** 2-3 active pharma, 1 expansion in negotiation
