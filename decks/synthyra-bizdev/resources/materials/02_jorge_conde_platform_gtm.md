# Panel Consultation: Jorge Conde

**Specialist:** Jorge Conde (a16z Bio)
**Focus:** Platform strategy, pharma go-to-market
**Date:** 2026-01-15

## Consultation Prompt

Evaluate SYNTHYRA's platform positioning and GTM strategy:
- Three product families: Drug Discovery, Biodefense, Safety & Toxicity
- Platform stack: DSM → CAMP → Synteract
- CEO uncertain on entry point, prefers pharma-first
- Open to partnership/co-development deals

## Response

### Platform vs. Wedge: The False Dichotomy

**Lead with a wedge, but architect it as a platform from day one.**

Nobody buys a "platform" in pharma. They buy solutions to specific problems. But companies that build lasting value are the ones where each customer engagement expands the platform's capabilities.

Mistakes to avoid:
- Over-indexing on platform narrative ("We can do everything!") = no urgency, 24-month sales cycle
- Over-indexing on services wedge = become a CRO, margins compress

**Recommendation:** Pick ONE use case where you can demonstrate 10x value in under 90 days, but structure every deal to capture data that feeds back into the platform.

### Which Product Family Has the Clearest Wedge?

**Safety & Toxicity — specifically Phase I viability screening.**

| Product Family | Buyer Clarity | Time to Value | Competitive Moat |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Systems Biology & Drug Discovery | Diffuse | 6-18 months | Crowded |
| Real-Time Biodefense | Clear | Long procurement | High but niche |
| **Safety & Toxicity** | **Very clear** | **30-60 days** | **Underserved** |

**Why Safety & Toxicity wins:**

1. **Pain is acute:** Phase I failures from off-target toxicity are devastating
2. **Buyer is clear:** Head of Toxicology, Head of Clinical Development, CMO
3. **Time to value is short:** Retrospective analysis in 30 days
4. **It's a regret minimization sale:** "What if you could have avoided that Phase I failure?"
5. **It expands naturally:** Into lead optimization, drug-drug interactions, discovery

### Clinical Trial Retrospective: Smart or Distraction?

**Smart — but only if executed correctly.**

Do:
- Pick a high-profile, recent failure the industry remembers
- Show you would have predicted the problem
- Partner with the company if possible
- Frame it about the system, not the failure
- Use it to open doors, not close deals

Don't:
- Position as "we're smarter than you"
- Monday-morning quarterback without collaboration

Consider a joint publication in Nature Biotechnology with a credible pharma partner.

### Positioning Against Chai Discovery

**Don't fight them on their turf. Reframe the conversation.**

Chai = structure-centric worldview ("What does this molecule bind to?")
SYNTHYRA = systems-scale biological impact ("What happens when this binding occurs?")

**The narrative:**
> "Predicting a molecular interaction is necessary but not sufficient. What matters is understanding the downstream cascade — the off-target effects, the pathway perturbations, the systemic toxicity signals. That requires proteome-scale screening at speeds that were impossible until now."

Tactically:
- Never mention Chai by name unless asked
- When asked, acknowledge their work is "interesting and complementary"
- Emphasize you operate at a different layer of the stack
- Use speed as a wedge: "375M interactions per second" is memorable

### Partnership vs. SaaS: The GTM Motion

**Start with co-development partnerships, transition to platform SaaS over 18-24 months.**

| Motion | Pros | Cons | When It Works |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| Pure SaaS | Scalable | Long sales cycle | After proven ROI |
| Services/CRO | Fast revenue | Low margins | Never as strategy |
| **Co-development** | **Strategic alignment, large deals** | **Resource intensive** | **Early stage** |

**Why co-development first:**
1. You need validation stories
2. You need to learn their workflows
3. Value-based pricing requires proof
4. Cash efficiency matters

**Transition plan:**
- Year 1: 2-3 co-development partnerships
- Year 2: Productize into self-service tox screening, launch SaaS
- Year 3: Expand to discovery, land-and-expand

### Bottom Line

1. Lead with Safety & Toxicity as your wedge
2. Execute the clinical trial retrospective as collaboration
3. Position above Chai, not against them
4. Start with 2-3 co-development partnerships
5. Price on outcomes when you can, but don't over-engineer initially

> *"The proteome-scale speed is genuinely differentiated. The question is whether you can convert that technical advantage into commercial traction before the window closes. You have maybe 18-24 months."*
