# SYNTHYRA Strategy Analysis

**Scenario:** SCENARIO-2026-002
**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

SYNTHYRA has compelling core technology (proteome-scale interaction screening at 375M PPI/sec) but is 6-9 months from being fundable at the target raise. The path forward requires a focused Safety & Toxicity wedge, partnership-first GTM, and 5 specific proof points before approaching investors.

## Panel Recommendations

### 1. GTM Strategy

| Decision | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Wedge** | Safety & Toxicity (Phase I viability, off-target screening) |
| **Why** | Clearest buyer (Tox leads, CMO), fastest time-to-value (30-60 days), underserved market |
| **Entry motion** | Co-development partnerships first, transition to SaaS in 18-24 months |
| **Target customer** | Mid-to-large biotech/pharma; consider innovation arms for faster cycles |
| **Attention hook** | Clinical trial retrospective — execute as collaboration, not criticism |

### 2. Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Relationship | Positioning |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Chai Discovery** | Direct competitor ($1.3B) | Position *above* them — systems layer vs. molecular layer |
| **Cradle** | Not direct | Different focus (design vs. interaction prediction) |
| **Boltz-2** | Not direct | Structure prediction vs. interaction-level compute |
| **Isomorphic Labs** | Adjacent | AlphaFold-based, different use cases |

**Narrative:** "Predicting a molecular interaction is necessary but not sufficient. We operate at the systems layer — understanding downstream cascade, off-target effects, and systemic toxicity signals."

### 3. Fundraising

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Target raise** | $12-18M (Goldilocks — 24-month runway, credible to pharma) |
| **Valuation** | $40-50M post-money |
| **Timeline** | 9-12 months to close (after proof points) |
| **Positioning** | "Series Seed" not "Pre-Seed" |

**Why not $6-8M:** Too vulnerable if pilot slips or key hire needed.
**Why not $50M+:** Can't deploy productively; punitive terms.

### 4. Pricing & Packaging

**First deal structure: Validation Pilot with Expansion Option**

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Price | $150K-$350K |
| Duration | 6-9 months |
| Scope | 2-3 programs, 50-100 compounds |
| Payment | 50% upfront, 25% interim, 25% completion |
| Success bonus | $25K-$50K if >80% prediction accuracy |

**Pricing model:** Hybrid (base platform access + per-compound usage + optional success bonus)

**Protected terms:** Case study rights, anonymized data retention, pre-negotiated expansion pricing, no broad exclusivity.

## Investability Gap Closure

### 5 Proof Points Required

| # | Proof Point | Timeline | Cost |
|---|-------------|----------|------|
| 1 | Benchmark vs. Chai/AlphaFold (published) | 8-12 weeks | Engineering time |
| 2 | Signed pilot ($50K+) with recognizable name | 12-20 weeks | BD effort |
| 3 | Safety/Tox case study (public data) | 4-6 weeks | Minimal |
| 4 | 1-2 SAB members with pharma credibility | 8-12 weeks | 0.1-0.25% equity |
| 5 | Investor-ready narrative deck | 2-4 weeks | Minimal |

### Execution Timeline

**Months 1-2:** Benchmark work, SAB outreach, case study, wedge refinement
**Months 3-4:** Benchmark complete, first pilot conversations, SAB #1 committed
**Months 5-6:** Benchmark published, pilot term sheet, SAB #2 committed
**Months 7-8:** Pilot signed, deck finalized, investor outreach begins
**Months 9-12:** Active fundraise, pilot generating results, close round

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Benchmark shows parity, not advantage | High | Run early; pivot positioning if needed |
| First pilot falls through | Medium | Maintain 3-5 parallel conversations |
| CEO bandwidth stretched | High | Fractional BD advisor in Month 3-4 |
| ESM2 base becomes obsolete | Medium | Roadmap for model upgrades; emphasize workflow, not just model |
