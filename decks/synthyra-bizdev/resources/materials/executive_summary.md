# SYNTHYRA — Executive Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Prepared for:** CEO
**Purpose:** VC Panel assessment of investability, GTM strategy, and pricing

---

## The Verdict

**SYNTHYRA is 6-9 months from being fundable at $12-18M.** The technology is compelling; the evidence base is thin. Close 5 proof points and the raise becomes straightforward.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Go-to-Market
- **Lead with Safety & Toxicity** — clearest buyer (Tox leads, CMO), fastest time-to-value (30-60 days)
- **Partnership-first motion** — co-development deals before SaaS; pharma prefers upfront economics
- **Clinical trial retrospective** — smart attention hook, but execute as collaboration, not criticism

### Competitive Positioning
- **Chai Discovery is the real competitor** ($1.3B valuation) — position above them (systems layer vs. molecular layer), not against
- **Cradle is not direct** — they do protein design, not interaction prediction
- **Speed alone is thin moat** — need accuracy benchmarks to defend differentiation

### Fundraising
- **Target:** $12-18M at $40-50M post-money
- **Not $6-8M:** Too vulnerable if pilot slips
- **Not $50M+:** Can't deploy productively; different game than Chai/Isomorphic
- **Timeline:** 9-12 months to close (after proof points)

### Pricing
- **First deal:** $150K-$350K validation pilot (6-9 months, 2-3 programs)
- **Model:** Hybrid — base platform access + per-compound usage + optional success bonus
- **Protect:** Case study rights, data retention, expansion pricing, no broad exclusivity

## Investability Gaps to Close

| Proof Point | Timeline |
|-------------|----------|
| Benchmark vs. Chai/AlphaFold (published) | 8-12 weeks |
| Signed pilot with recognizable pharma | 12-20 weeks |
| Safety/Tox case study (public data) | 4-6 weeks |
| 1-2 SAB members with pharma credibility | 8-12 weeks |
| Investor-ready narrative deck | 2-4 weeks |

**Critical path:** Benchmark → Pilot → Raise

1. Start CASP benchmark analysis
2. Pull public drug withdrawal data for case study
3. Draft 3 SAB candidate profiles
4. Refine Safety & Tox wedge pitch to 2 minutes

**Next 30 days:**
1. Complete retrospective toxicity case study

## Bottom Line

The technology is real. The market is real. The gap is evidence.

Close the benchmark, sign one pilot, and you're in position to raise $12-18M and build a category-defining company in proteome-scale safety screening.
