## Pricing Philosophy

Based on panel input:
1. **Start small, learn fast** — pilots are for validation, not revenue optimization
2. **Don't anchor too low** — first deals set expectations
3. **Create expansion path** — structure pilots to invite follow-on
4. **Consider skin-in-the-game** — outcome-based options build trust

## Pilot Pricing by Segment

### Mid-Tier Pharma

| Pilot Type | Price Range | Duration | Deliverables |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Retrospective validation | $75-150K | 60-90 days | Analysis of 5-10 historical failures; mechanistic hypotheses |
| Prospective screening | $100-200K | 90-120 days | Proteome-wide screen of 3-5 active compounds; interaction reports |
| Pipeline prioritization | $150-250K | 90-120 days | Full portfolio analysis; ranked risk assessment |

**Notes:**
- Pharma expects polished deliverables and formal reporting
- Include 2-3 review meetings in scope
- Avoid going below $75K — signals lack of confidence

---

### Biotech (Series B+)

| Pilot Type | Price Range | Duration | Deliverables |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Lead compound screen | $25-50K | 30-45 days | Proteome interaction profile for 1-3 leads |
| Off-target analysis | $40-75K | 45-60 days | Detailed off-target map + safety hypotheses |
| Target validation support | $50-100K | 60-90 days | Interaction network analysis for target |

**Notes:**
- Biotech values speed over polish
- Decision-makers are often accessible (CEO, CSO)
- Can move faster; may have tighter budgets

---

### CROs

| Pilot Type | Price Range | Duration | Deliverables |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Capability demo | $15-30K | 30 days | Analysis on sample compounds; integration discussion |
| Joint client pilot | Revenue share | Varies | Co-deliver to their client |

**Notes:**
- CROs may want to white-label or resell
- Consider partnership structures, not just transactional sales
- Lower upfront, potential for volume

---

### Academic

| Pilot Type | Price Range | Duration | Deliverables |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Research collaboration | $10-25K | 60-90 days | Analysis + co-authorship opportunity |
| Discounted license | $15-40K/year | Annual | Platform access for research use |

**Notes:**
- Revenue is secondary; credibility is primary
- Require publication rights or case study permission
- Good for building evidence base

---

## Outcome-Based Options

For customers hesitant on upfront pricing, offer:

### Option A: Success Fee
- **Structure:** 50% upfront + 50% on successful validation
- **Definition of success:** Customer confirms predictions matched outcomes within 12 months
- **Risk:** Revenue delay; requires trust in customer honesty
- **Use when:** Customer is skeptical but engaged

### Option B: Pilot-to-Platform
- **Structure:** Pilot fee credited toward annual platform subscription
- **Example:** $50K pilot; if they sign $200K annual, pilot fee is credited
- **Risk:** May attract tire-kickers
- **Use when:** Strong expansion potential

### Option C: Risk Share
- **Structure:** Lower base fee + bonus if predictions prove out
- **Example:** $30K base + $50K bonus if 3+ predictions validated in 18 months
- **Risk:** Long payment cycle; tracking complexity
- **Use when:** Highly skeptical buyer; need to build trust

## Pricing Conversation Guide

### Opening
> "Pilots typically range from $25K to $150K depending on scope and deliverables. What would be most useful for your team?"

### If They Push Back on Price
> "I hear you. What would make this feel like obvious value? We can adjust scope to fit budget, or we can structure outcome-based terms if that builds more confidence."

### If They Want Free/Discount
> "We're not doing free pilots — we've found that customers don't take them seriously. But we can do a smaller scope at a lower price point, or structure it so you only pay the full amount if the predictions are useful."

### If They Need Internal Approval
> "What does your approval process look like? We can provide a one-pager or get on a call with whoever needs to sign off."

## Expansion Path

Structure every pilot to invite follow-on:

1. **In the proposal:** "This pilot covers [X]. If results are positive, typical next steps include [Y] at [price range]."

2. **In the final deliverable:** Include a "recommended next steps" section with specific expansion options.

3. **In the wrap-up call:** "Based on what we found, here's what we'd recommend for phase 2..."

---

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't go below $25K for pharma/biotech** — signals desperation or low value
2. **Don't offer unlimited scope** — scope creep kills margins
3. **Don't skip the contract** — even small pilots need terms
4. **Don't promise strategic partnership terms in pilot pricing** — that's a different conversation
5. **Don't discount without getting something** — case study rights, referral commitment, etc.

**Remember:** The pilot price isn't the point. The point is learning what customers value and building toward expansion.
