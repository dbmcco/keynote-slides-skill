# Panel Consultation: Bruce Booth

**Specialist:** Bruce Booth (Atlas Venture)
**Focus:** Capital efficiency, seed-stage investability
**Date:** 2026-01-15

## Consultation Prompt

Evaluate SYNTHYRA for seed-stage investability:
- Pre-revenue, pre-pilot, targeting ~$15M seed
- Core tech: 375M PPI/sec proteome screening
- GTM: Pharma-first, clinical trial retrospective as attention hook
- 12-month goal: 1-3 LOIs, potentially a pilot

---

## Response

### Overall Take

**This is a challenging investment at $15M seed given the competitive dynamics**, but not impossible if you execute with surgical precision on capital efficiency.

### Is $15M the Right Ask?

**No, it's likely too high for where you are.**

- Pre-revenue, pre-LOI, no pilots closed
- Chai Discovery at $225M raised means they can outspend you 15:1
- Your 12-month goal is achievable on $5-8M

**Recommendation:** Raise $6-8M seed with clear milestones to Series A:
- 6-9 months runway to close first pilot ($2-3M burn)
- Technical proof points that differentiate from Chai ($1-2M)
- Buffer for deal slippage ($2M)

$15M creates pressure to show proportional progress. If you raise $15M and only land 1 pilot in 18 months, your Series A story is broken.

### Traction Signals Required

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| 1 signed pilot (even small) | Proves someone will pay |
| Technical benchmark vs. Chai | Head-to-head on same dataset |
| Named pharma champion | VP-level internal advocate |
| Clear wedge | One use case where you're definitively better |

The clinical trial retrospective is interesting as an attention hook, but it's not traction. It's marketing.

### Capital Efficiency vs. Competitive Pressure

**You cannot out-capitalize Chai/Isomorphic. Stop trying.**

Play a different game:
- Their game: Platform breadth, massive compute, general-purpose tools
- Your game: Specific high-value wedges with defensible expertise

**Capital-efficient moves:**
- Pick ONE indication area
- Build the deepest dataset/model for that wedge
- Become the "call first" company for that specific problem

**Capital-inefficient moves (avoid):**
- Matching their product breadth
- Building enterprise sales team before repeatable sales
- Biodefense pivot to chase government money

### Partnership vs. Product Sales

**Unambiguously: Partnership deals first.**

| Approach | Capital Required | Time to Revenue | Validation Signal |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Product sales | High | 12-18 months | Weak |
| Partnership/pilot | Low | 6-9 months | Strong |

Ideal early deal structure:
1. Paid pilot ($50-250K) with defined success criteria
2. Option to expand if pilot succeeds
3. Data rights for publishing/reference
4. Named case study rights upon completion

Don't give away the first deal for free. Even $50K signals they're serious.

### What Would Make This Investable

1. Tighter raise: $6-8M, not $15M
2. One signed pilot with a top-50 pharma
3. Clear technical differentiation memo vs. Chai
4. Focused wedge strategy
5. Founder-led sales plan

### Verdict

**Not investable today at $15M. Potentially investable at $6-8M with one signed pilot and clear Chai differentiation.**
