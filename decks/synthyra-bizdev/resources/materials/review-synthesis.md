**Framework:** Minto Pyramid with SCQA opener

## Strengths
- Clear verdict up front and explicit proof-point gate structure.
- Pricing and deal terms are concrete, making the ask feel real.

## Recommended Changes
**Messaging:** Simplify platform jargon on the infrastructure slide.  
**Audience Fit:** Keep proof-point language in every slide to reinforce alignment.  
**Visuals:** Consider a single proof-point checklist visual to reduce text density.  
**Cuts:** If time is short, trim the platform detail and keep the verdict, wedge, and plan.  
**Accuracy:** Ensure benchmark claims are referenced to CASP/STRING/BioGRID sources.

## Points Requiring Decision
- **Proof vs. Product Depth:** Keep full platform detail or compress to one slide?
- **GTM Motion:** Emphasize partnership-first now or introduce SaaS transition later?

## Overall Assessment
