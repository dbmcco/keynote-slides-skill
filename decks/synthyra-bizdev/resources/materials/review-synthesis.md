# Review Panel Synthesis

**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Framework:** The Heist (proof-point vault)

## Strengths
- Reveal lands: raise depends on spectacular tech plus proof.
- Heist structure keeps focus on proof points, owners, and timeline.
- Pricing and deal terms are concrete, making the plan feel executable.

## Recommended Changes
**Messaging:** Keep the systems-layer positioning crisp and consistent across slides.  
**Audience Fit:** Reinforce the "proof is the product" line in the opening and twist.  
**Visuals:** Consider a single proof-point checklist visual to reduce text density.  
**Cuts:** If time is short, compress platform details and keep wedge, twist, and plan.  
**Accuracy:** Ensure benchmark claims are tied to CASP/STRING/BioGRID sources.

## Points Requiring Decision
- **Proof vs. Product Depth:** Keep full platform detail or compress to one slide?
- **GTM Motion:** Emphasize partnership-first now or introduce SaaS transition later?

## Overall Assessment
**Ready?** Yes with minor edits  
**Most important:** Close the five proof points before narrative expansion.  
**Efficacy confidence:** 82%
