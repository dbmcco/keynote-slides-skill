# Predetermined Elements (Known Facts & Constraints)

## Market Facts

1. **AI toxicology/prediction market is real and growing** — $360M (2023) → $5B (2033), 30% CAGR, FDA tailwinds
2. **Big deals are strategic partnerships, not SaaS** — Successful exits (InSilico, Recursion) came through co-development deals with milestones + royalties, not product sales
3. **Deal sizes bifurcate** — Small pilots ($25-100K) or strategic partnerships ($200M+); little middle ground
4. **Clinical trial prediction tools exist but aren't operationally deployed in pharma** — Gap between academic validation and workflow integration
5. **Pharma BD cycles are 12-24 months** — Significant deals take time; desperation is visible and exploited

## Synthyra's Current Position

1. **Pre-revenue, no customer conversations** — Logical case strong, but unvalidated
2. **90% accuracy claim will be publishable** — But publication alone gets a meeting, not a deal
3. **Platform has genuine technical differentiation** — Proteome-scale throughput (375M PPI/sec) is rare
4. **No prospective validation on pharma data** — Retrospective only
5. **Open to partnership model** — Not locked into product sales framing

## Constraints

1. **Runway** — Pre-revenue; cannot wait 18-36 months for big deal without interim revenue
2. **Credibility gap** — No reference customers, no pharma relationships, no SAB with pharma connections
3. **Validation type** — Retrospective accuracy ≠ prospective utility; pharma knows this
4. **Internal pharma dynamics** — "Not Invented Here" resistance, workflow integration challenges, misaligned incentives (teams rewarded for advancing, not killing programs)

## What's Effectively Locked In

- Publication alone will not close deals
- First deals will be small (pilots, not strategic partnerships)
- 18-36 month timeline to real partnership leverage is realistic
- Need prospective validation on blinded pharma data to be credible
- Pharma will have asymmetric power in early negotiations

## Opposition Pass (Disconfirmers)

**What could make these "facts" wrong:**

1. **A breakout scientific result** (e.g., predicting a high-profile failure that makes news) could accelerate timeline
2. **Strategic acquirer interest** could change negotiating dynamics
3. **Regulatory mandate** for computational safety screening could create sudden demand
4. **Competitor stumble** (e.g., InSilico fails publicly) could open market share
5. **Warm introduction to desperate pharma partner** with urgent pipeline problem could shortcut BD cycle
