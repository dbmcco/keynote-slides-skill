# Pitch Reframes

**Scenario:** SCENARIO-2026-010
**Created:** 2026-01-15

## The Problem with the Current Pitch

**Current framing:** "We have 90% accuracy predicting clinical trial failures using proteome-scale interaction prediction."

**Why it doesn't work:**
1. Base rate of trial failure is already ~90% — saying "fail" always gets you there
2. Accuracy claims trigger skepticism — pharma has seen hundreds of these
3. "Prediction" positions you as a late-stage gatekeeper, not an early-stage enabler
4. It's about your capability, not their problem

## Reframe 1: Specific Failures Caught

### Don't Say
> "We have 90% accuracy predicting clinical trial failures."

### Do Say
> "Here's what we would have told you about [Compound X] 18 months before it failed Phase II:
> - Off-target interaction with hERG at therapeutic concentrations
> - Unexpected binding to CYP3A4 suggesting drug-drug interaction risk
> - The specific mechanism that led to the cardiotoxicity signal
>
> We can run this analysis on your current pipeline."

### Why It Works
- Concrete, verifiable, specific
- Shows mechanistic insight, not just prediction
- Invites them to test you on their own compounds
- Positions as "insight partner" not "prediction vendor"

---

## Reframe 2: Interrogation Capacity

### Don't Say
> "We predict clinical trial failures with proteome-scale interaction prediction."

### Do Say
> "We make the proteome searchable at scale.
>
> At 375 million interactions per second, you can ask questions you couldn't ask before:
> - 'What's the full off-target landscape of this compound across the human proteome?'
> - 'Which tissue compartments will see accumulation?'
> - 'What happens to the interaction profile if we modify this binding site?'
>
> It's not about predicting failures — it's about seeing what you couldn't see before."

### Why It Works
- Emphasizes capability moat (throughput + accuracy)
- Positions as infrastructure, not tool
- Opens conversation to multiple use cases
- Avoids narrow "failure prediction" trap

---

## Reframe 3: Partnership Framing

### Don't Say
> "We're looking for a strategic partnership to deploy our platform."

### Do Say
> "We're running validation pilots with 3-4 pharma and biotech partners this quarter.
>
> We're looking for teams with active programs who want to test our predictions prospectively — you give us structures, we give you interaction profiles, and we see how the predictions hold up.
>
> If it works, we talk about deeper integration. If it doesn't, we both learned something."

### Why It Works
- Signals you're not desperate
- Creates scarcity ("3-4 partners")
- Offers skin in the game
- Makes it easy to say yes (pilot, not commitment)

---

## Reframe 4: Value Proposition

### Don't Say
> "Our platform can save you money by predicting failures earlier."

### Do Say
> "A Phase II failure costs $50-100M. A Phase III failure costs $500M-1B.
>
> We're not offering 'savings' — we're offering a different decision-making substrate.
>
> What if your project teams could see the full proteome interaction landscape before they committed to a lead series? Not to kill programs, but to choose better starting points and optimize around real liabilities."

### Why It Works
- Speaks their language (cost structure)
- Reframes from "cost savings" to "better decisions"
- Addresses the incentive problem (teams don't want to kill programs)
- Positions as enabler, not gatekeeper

---

## Reframe 5: Limitations Pitch

### Don't Say
> "Our platform can predict any trial failure."

### Do Say
> "We're strongest on:
> - Off-target interaction profiles (92% accuracy on held-out validation)
> - Proteome-scale selectivity screening
> - Mechanism-of-toxicity hypotheses
>
> We're weaker on:
> - PK/ADME (we focus on target interactions, not metabolism)
> - Efficacy prediction (we tell you what it binds, not whether that binding matters clinically)
> - Novel mechanisms we haven't trained on
>
> If your failure modes are in our strength areas, we should talk."

### Why It Works
- Honesty builds trust faster than overclaiming
- Shows sophistication about your own technology
- Helps them self-qualify
- Positions you as expert, not salesperson

## Pitch Deck Structure (Recommended)

1. **The Problem** (1 slide)
   - "Phase II failure rate: 70%. Average cost: $50-100M."
   - "Most failures are predictable in hindsight. Why not in advance?"

2. **Specific Example** (1-2 slides)
   - "[Public Compound X] failed Phase II due to [mechanism]."
   - "Here's what our platform would have shown 18 months earlier."

3. **The Platform** (1 slide)
   - Interrogation capacity framing, not prediction framing
   - 375M PPI/sec, proteome-scale, mechanistic insight

4. **The Ask** (1 slide)
   - "We're running validation pilots this quarter."
   - "We want to test our predictions on your pipeline — prospectively."

5. **Terms** (if they ask)
   - Pilot: $25-75K, 30-60 days, specific deliverables
   - Success: "You tell us if the predictions were useful."

## One-Liner Variants

**For BD/Partnership audiences:**
> "We make the human proteome searchable at pharma-scale throughput."

**For Discovery/R&D audiences:**
> "We show you the full off-target landscape before you pick your lead series."

**For Safety/Tox audiences:**
> "We generate mechanistic toxicity hypotheses from proteome-scale interaction data."

**For Executives:**
> "We turn proteome data into earlier go/no-go decisions."

**Remember:** The pitch isn't about convincing them you're accurate. It's about making them want to test you.
