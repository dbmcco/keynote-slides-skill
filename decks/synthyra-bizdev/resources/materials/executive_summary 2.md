# Executive Summary: Synthyra GTM Strategy

**Scenario:** SCENARIO-2026-010 | **Date:** 2026-01-15

---

## The Question

How does Synthyra get access to customers? What's the wedge, what are we selling, and at what price?

## The Reframe

After context enrichment and panel review, the question shifted:

> **From:** "What product wedge opens doors?"
> **To:** "How do we learn what customers want while building toward strategic partnerships?"

---

## Key Insights

### 1. The Wedge Isn't Yours to Choose
Your hypothesized wedges (trial failure prediction, toxicity screening, interaction mapping) are all plausible. But the actual wedge will emerge from customer response, not internal logic. **Run experiments; let the market tell you.**

### 2. 90% Accuracy Gets a Meeting, Not a Deal
Pharma is skeptical of accuracy claims — the base rate of trial failure is already ~90%. What matters:
- **Prospective validation** on blinded pharma data
- **Mechanistic specificity** ("fails due to hERG liability" not just "fails")
- **Specific examples** of failures you would have caught

### 3. Strategic Deals Require Leverage You Don't Have Yet
InSilico-style deals ($200M+) came after 5+ years of validation, multiple programs, and an IPO. You're 18-24 months from that conversation. **Build pilots first; don't chase big deals yet.**

### 4. The Market Is Bimodal
Pricing splits into small pilots ($25-100K) or large strategic deals ($200M+), with little in between. **Start small; earn your way to big.**

### 5. Prepare for Model Failure
Your model will be publicly wrong at some point. Diversify customers, limit contractual liability, and be honest about limitations. **Don't let one bad call be existential.**

## Recommendation: Hybrid Barbell Strategy

| Allocation | Activity | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **60%** | Diversified pilots ($25-100K) | Cash flow, learning, optionality |
| **20%** | One strategic partnership track | Credibility, upside optionality |
| **20%** | Platform narrative + infrastructure | Long-term positioning |

### 90-Day Kickoff

1. **Weeks 1-4:** Build target list (15 potential customers), finalize pitch deck
2. **Weeks 2-6:** Launch outreach; aim for 10+ conversations
3. **Weeks 4-8:** Close first 2-3 pilots ($25-75K each)
4. **Weeks 6-12:** Recruit first SAB member with pharma connections

### Decision Gates

| Milestone | Timing | Decision |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 3 pilots signed | Month 6 | Continue diversification or concentrate? |
| Clear use case pattern | Month 9 | Focus resources on winning segment |
| No pattern after 8 pilots | Month 12 | Question market thesis |

---

## Pitch Reframes

| Don't Say | Do Say |
|-----------|--------|
| "We have 90% accuracy" | "Here's what we would have told you about Compound X before it failed" |
| "We predict trial failures" | "We make the proteome searchable at scale" |
| "We want a strategic partnership" | "We're running pilots to validate our approach" |

---

## Risks to Monitor

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| No clear wedge emerges | Continue diversification; question thesis at Month 12 |
| Runway pressure | Prioritize cash-flow pilots; consider bridge financing |
| Model fails publicly | Diversified customer base; contractual liability limits |
| Strategic partner interest too early | Don't chase; you lack leverage |

---

## Success Metrics

**6 Months:**
- 4-6 paying pilot customers
- Clear signal on which use case resonates
- Runway extended through revenue

**12 Months:**
- 8-10 paying customers
- 2+ repeat/expansion customers
- Decision made: concentrate or continue diversifying

**18-24 Months:**
- Validated wedge through customer behavior
- Strategic deal signed with leverage OR profitable diversified business

---

## Bottom Line

**Don't pick the wedge — discover it.** Run many small experiments, learn fast, preserve optionality. Build toward strategic partnerships, but don't chase them until you have leverage. The question isn't "what's the right answer?" — it's "how do we learn the answer while surviving?"
