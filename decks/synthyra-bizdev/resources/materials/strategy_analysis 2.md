# Strategy Analysis & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Synthyra should pursue a **Hybrid Barbell strategy**: run diversified small pilots (60% effort) while maintaining one strategic partnership track (20%) and building platform positioning (20%). This approach maximizes learning velocity, preserves optionality, and generates early cash flow while keeping upside exposure to larger deals.

**The core insight from this panel:** The question isn't "what's the wedge?" — it's "how do we learn what the wedge is while surviving long enough to act on it?"

## Primary Recommendation: Option D (Hybrid Barbell)

### Why This Path

1. **Matches your risk posture** — You default to exploring multiple avenues; this formalizes that instinct
2. **Addresses primary uncertainty** — You don't know what pharma will pay for; this tests multiple hypotheses in parallel
3. **Generates survival cash flow** — Small pilots fund the timeline to bigger opportunities
4. **Preserves strategic optionality** — You can concentrate once signal emerges

### The 90-Day Kickoff

| Week | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1-2 | Finalize pitch deck with dual framing (accuracy + interrogation capacity) | Founder |
| 1-4 | Build target list: 15 potential pilot customers across segments | Founder |
| 2-4 | Identify 2-3 SAB candidates with pharma BD connections | Founder |
| 3-6 | Launch outreach; aim for 10+ conversations | Founder |
| 4-8 | Close first 2-3 pilots ($25-75K each) | Founder |
| 6-12 | Recruit first SAB member | Founder |

### Decision Gates

| Milestone | Timing | Decision |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 3 pilots signed | Month 6 | Continue diversification or concentrate? |
| Clear use case pattern | Month 9 | Focus resources on winning segment |
| Strategic partner engaged | Month 9-12 | Accelerate partnership track |
| No clear pattern after 8 pilots | Month 12 | Question market thesis; consider pivot |

## Key Reframes from Panel

### On the Wedge Question

**Old framing:** "What capability opens the door?"
**New framing:** "How do we become partnership-worthy while learning what customers actually want?"

The wedge isn't something you choose; it's something you discover through customer contact.

### On the 90% Accuracy Claim

**Old framing:** "This should get their attention"
**New framing:** "This gets a meeting, not a deal"

What matters:
- **Prospective validation** on blinded pharma data (not retrospective)
- **Mechanistic specificity** ("fails due to hERG liability" not just "fails")
- **Lift over base rate** (trial failure rate is already ~90%)

**Action:** Reframe the pitch around specific failures you would have caught, not accuracy percentages.

### On the Buyer

**Old framing:** "Senior VP managing portfolio"
**New framing:** "Multiple entry points depending on deal type"

| Deal Type | Entry Point |
|-----------|-------------|
| Small pilot | External innovation / scouting |
| Workflow integration | Computational chemistry lead |
| Strategic partnership | BD / partnerships team |

**Action:** Test all three; let conversion rates reveal the right path.

### On Pricing

**Old framing:** "What will they pay?"
**New framing:** "Bimodal market — small pilots or big deals, not much middle"

| Segment | Price Range | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Academic | $10-25K | Learning, publications |
| Biotech/CRO | $25-75K | Revenue, validation |
| Pharma pilot | $100-200K | Flagship case study |
| Strategic deal | $5-15M upfront | Later stage, requires leverage |

**Action:** Start with $25-75K pilots; don't chase strategic deals until you have leverage.

## Risk Mitigation

### Taleb's Warning: Prepare for Model Failure

Your model will be publicly wrong at some point. Prepare now:

1. **Diversify customer base** — One failure shouldn't be existential
2. **Contractual protections** — Limit liability in pilot agreements
3. **Honest limitations** — Tell customers what you can't predict; builds trust
4. **Narrative preparation** — "We're improving" not "we were wrong"

### Booth's Warning: Don't Chase Deals You're Not Ready For

- No strategic deal in the next 6 months — you lack leverage
- First deal sets precedent — don't accept bad terms out of desperation
- Never sign exclusivity — preserve optionality

### Lowe's Warning: Workflow Integration Is Hard

- "Not Invented Here" resistance is real
- Project teams are rewarded for advancing, not killing programs
- Your champion needs a one-sentence explanation of your value

---

## What Success Looks Like

### 6 Months
- 4-6 paying customers (pilots)
- Clear signal on which use case resonates
- 1-2 SAB members with pharma connections
- Runway extended through revenue

### 12 Months
- 8-10 paying customers
- 2+ repeat/expansion customers
- At least one strategic conversation active
- Decision made: concentrate or continue diversifying

### 18-24 Months
- Clear wedge validated through customer behavior
- Either: strategic deal signed with leverage
- Or: profitable diversified business funding continued growth

## Internal Baseline Mismatch Map

| Your Base Case | Panel Reality Check |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "Pilots happen, learning happens, but no clear wedge emerges" | Possible — but the goal is to *accelerate* learning, not just wait for insight |
| "Senior VP is the buyer" | Maybe — but test multiple entry points |
| "90% accuracy should get attention" | Gets a meeting, not a deal; reframe around specific failures |
| "Pilots in $50-100K range" | Realistic for pharma; may need $25-50K for biotech/CRO |

---

## Calibration Note

**Confidence in recommendation:** Medium-high

This recommendation is robust across most scenarios because it's designed to *learn* rather than *bet*. The main risk is execution complexity — running three tracks with a small team is hard.

**What would change this recommendation:**
- Strong signal from first 3 pilots → concentrate faster
- Strategic partner shows serious interest early → accelerate that track
- Runway crisis → prioritize cash flow over positioning
