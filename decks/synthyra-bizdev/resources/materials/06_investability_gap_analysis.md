## Gap Inventory

### Technical Validation Gaps

| Gap | Current State | Required State | Severity |
|-----|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Accuracy benchmarks | Internal only | Published vs. AlphaFold/Chai | Critical |
| Throughput verification | Self-reported | Third-party or partner attestation | High |
| Chai differentiation | Verbal claims | Head-to-head comparison data | Critical |
| End-to-end workflow | Working internally | Demonstrated on real pharma use case | High |
| Safety/Tox accuracy | Unknown externally | ROC/AUC on known toxic compounds | High |

### Commercial Traction Gaps

| Gap | Current State | Required State | Severity |
|-----|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Signed pilot | Zero | At least 1 paid agreement | Critical |
| Pharma relationships | Conversations | LOI from Top 20 pharma | Critical |
| Revenue | Pre-revenue | Even $50K signals validation | High |
| Pipeline visibility | Informal | 3-5 qualified named accounts | Medium |
| Pricing validation | Theoretical | At least 1 pharma reviewed | Medium |

### Team/Capability Gaps

| Gap | Current State | Required State | Severity |
|-----|---------------|----------------|----------|
| BD/Commercial | CEO doing everything | Fractional BD or advisor | High |
| Scientific advisory | Unknown | 2-3 credible names | Medium |
| GTM clarity | Uncertain | CEO can articulate wedge in 2 min | High |

### Narrative/Positioning Gaps

| Gap | Current State | Required State | Severity |
|-----|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Wedge clarity | "We do proteomics" | "THE safety/tox prediction layer" | Critical |
| Competitive moat | "We're faster" | "Faster AND more accurate on X" | High |
| Why now? | Implicit | Explicit thesis | Medium |

## Priority Stack-Rank

### Tier 1: Must Close Before Raising (3-6 months)

1. **Publish accuracy benchmarks vs. Chai/AlphaFold**
   - Single most important gap
   - Without it, technical diligence kills the deal

2. **Sign 1 paid pilot with recognizable name**
   - Transforms narrative from "interesting tech" to "pharma-validated"

3. **Crystallize Safety & Tox wedge positioning**
   - Stop being general-purpose, become THE safety/tox layer

### Tier 2: Should Close Before Raising (6-9 months)

4. **Secure 1-2 SAB members with pharma credibility**
5. **Develop co-development partnership structure**

### Tier 3: Can Close During/After Raise

6. **Fractional BD hire** (fund from round)
7. **Expand pipeline to 3-5 opportunities**

## Proof Point Checklist

### Proof Point 1: Benchmark Publication
- **Deliverable:** Technical report comparing Synteract to Chai/AlphaFold2/3
- **Metrics:** RMSD, accuracy/precision/recall for PPI
- **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks
- **Cost:** Engineering time only

### Proof Point 2: Signed Pilot Agreement
- **Deliverable:** Paid pilot or LOI with Top 50 pharma
- **Structure:** $50K-150K for 3-6 month evaluation
- **Timeline:** 12-20 weeks
- **Cost:** BD effort + potentially discounted pricing

### Proof Point 3: Safety & Tox Case Study
- **Deliverable:** 1-page showing prediction of known toxicity
- **Data source:** Public drug withdrawal data
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
- **Cost:** Minimal

### Proof Point 4: Scientific Advisor Commitment
- **Deliverable:** 1-2 SAB members with pharma backgrounds
- **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks
- **Cost:** 0.1-0.25% equity per advisor

### Proof Point 5: Investor-Ready Narrative Deck
- **Deliverable:** 12-15 slides with wedge, proof points, ask
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (after other proof points)
- **Cost:** Minimal

## Timeline to Investability

```
Month 1-2:    Benchmark work begins
              SAB outreach starts
              Safety & Tox case study (public data)
              Refine wedge positioning

Month 3-4:    Benchmark draft complete
              First pilot conversations
              SAB #1 committed

Month 5-6:    Benchmark published
              Pilot term sheet in negotiation
              SAB #2 committed

Month 7-8:    Pilot signed
              Narrative deck finalized
              Begin investor outreach

Month 9-10:   Active fundraise
              Pilot generating early results

Month 11-12:  Close round
```

**Realistic timeline: 9-12 months to close $12-18M round**

## Chicken-and-Egg Breakers

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Need BD but no capital | CEO does first 1-2 pilots personally |
| Pharma wants proof, proof needs pharma data | Use public drug withdrawal data |
| Top pharma takes forever | Target innovation arms or mid-tier |
| Benchmark requires engineering time | 2-3 week sprint, not ongoing |

## Low-Cost De-Risking (Current Runway)

### Immediate (Weeks 1-4)
- Retrospective toxicity analysis (public data) — $0
- CASP benchmark run — $0
- Wedge messaging refinement — $0

### Near-Term (Weeks 5-12)
- SAB recruitment — 0.1-0.25% equity
- Warm intro campaign — $0
- Conference visibility — $500-2000
- LinkedIn/content strategy — $0

## Final Verdict

**SYNTHYRA is 6-9 months from fundable at $12-18M.**

**Critical path:** Benchmark → Pilot → Raise

**Biggest risk:** CEO bandwidth — must drive BD while overseeing technical validation.

**The technology is real. The market is real. The gap is evidence.**
