A mesmerizing data visualization of instant proteome interrogation.

Dark blue-black background (#1a1a2e). Center of frame: a glowing purple orb pulsing with energy - this is the query origin point.

The animation begins: from the purple center, thousands of fine cyan (#00b5d8) luminous lines radiate outward in all directions, like a starburst or neural network activating. The lines connect to small glowing nodes scattered across the frame.

As the search radiates outward, 5-8 nodes suddenly pulse bright amber/orange (#ed8936) - these are the "hits" found in the proteome scan. They glow and pulse while the rest remain cyan.

Subtle particle effects flow along the connection lines, suggesting massive data throughput. Speed lines and motion blur emphasize the velocity.

In the lower right corner, the text "375M/sec" fades in with a subtle glow effect.

The overall feeling: watching a real-time search across the entire human proteome - instant, comprehensive, illuminating what was previously hidden. Like watching a radar sweep but for molecular biology.

Style: Abstract data visualization, clean and modern, no photorealism. Think: high-end biotech company brand video meets scientific visualization.

Duration: 8 seconds. Smooth, fluid motion. Professional, awe-inspiring.
