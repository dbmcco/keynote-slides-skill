Create a square infographic visualizing high-speed proteome interrogation.

SIZE & PLACEMENT:
- Output: 1000px × 1000px (square, will display at ~450×450px on slide)
- Placement: Left side of split layout, below headline, as hero visual
- Network nodes should be visually distinct at 50% scale

LAYOUT: Central Hub with radiating network connections.
Leave 10% margin on all edges for breathing room.

STYLE: Glassmorphism or modern data visualization aesthetic.
Dark background (#1a1a2e). Glowing/luminous elements.
Color palette: Cyan (#00b5d8) for network nodes and connections,
amber (#ed8936) for highlighted "hits" or found interactions,
purple (#805ad5) for the central query origin point.
No photorealism — abstract, modern, tech-forward.

TYPOGRAPHY: One key stat prominently displayed: "375M/sec" in bold white, 48pt+
Minimal other text — this is a visual concept piece, not a data table.

CONTENT TO VISUALIZE:
Synthyra makes the entire human proteome searchable in real-time.

The human proteome contains ~20,000 proteins with millions of possible interactions.
Traditional tools check one protein-protein interaction at a time — taking weeks
to map a single compound's off-target landscape.

Synthyra processes 375 MILLION interactions per second. The full human proteome
(all possible pairwise interactions) can be queried in under 2 seconds.

Visual concept:
- CENTER: A glowing query point (purple #805ad5) — this represents the compound
  or protein being tested. Should feel like an "origin" or "source" of the search.

- RADIATING OUTWARD: Thousands of small protein nodes (cyan #00b5d8) connected
  by fine luminous lines. The network should feel MASSIVE — we're talking about
  searching everything at once.

- HIGHLIGHTED NODES: Some nodes (maybe 5-10) pulse bright amber (#ed8936) —
  these are the "hits," the interactions found. They stand out from the cyan network.

- MOTION SUGGESTION: Include particle trails, speed lines, or data flow indicators
  suggesting real-time, massive-scale processing. The search is FAST.

- KEY STAT: "375M/sec" displayed prominently — either in the center or lower corner.

Overall feeling: "This is infrastructure-level capability. We're not checking one
thing at a time — we're searching the entire proteome instantly. This changes
what questions you can even ask."
