Create a WIDE horizontal workflow diagram (4:1 aspect ratio, like a banner).

CRITICAL - ASPECT RATIO:
This MUST be a wide horizontal strip, NOT a square.
Think: 4x wider than it is tall. Like a website header banner.

LAYOUT:
4 stages in a single horizontal row, left to right:
GENERATE → ANNOTATE → SCREEN → DECIDE

Each stage is a simple colored box with:
- Large bold label (the stage name) - minimum 60pt font
- Small subtext below - minimum 36pt font
- Simple icon above the label

Arrows connect each stage horizontally.

STAGE DETAILS:
1. GENERATE (Purple #805ad5 background)
   - Icon: DNA helix
   - Subtext: "100-1000 candidates"

2. ANNOTATE (Cyan #00b5d8 background)
   - Icon: Tag/label
   - Subtext: "Function + pathways"

3. SCREEN (Amber #ed8936 background)
   - Icon: Grid/radar
   - Subtext: "Proteome-wide scan"

4. DECIDE (Green #38a169 background)
   - Icon: Checkmark
   - Subtext: "Go/no-go in seconds"

STYLE:
- Clean flat design, no gradients or shadows
- White text on colored backgrounds
- White or very light gray (#fafbfc) background behind the stages
- Large chunky arrows between stages
- Bold sans-serif font (like Helvetica Bold or Inter Bold)
- LARGE TEXT - this will be displayed small, so text must be huge

DO NOT:
- Do not make this square
- Do not include detailed descriptions or paragraphs
- Do not make text smaller than 36pt
- Do not add extra visual complexity
