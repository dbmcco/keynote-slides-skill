Create a horizontal workflow diagram showing Synthyra's platform pipeline.

SIZE & PLACEMENT:
- Output: 2000px wide × 500px tall (will display at ~1000×250px on slide)
- Placement: Full width below the existing platform stack, spanning both columns
- Icons should be 80px+ at output size, text 28pt+ for readability at 50% scale

LAYOUT: Flowchart Nodes. Linear horizontal progression with 4 connected stages.
Equal spacing between nodes. Clean arrow connectors flowing left to right.
Leave 5% margin on left/right edges.

STYLE: Flat vector art with subtle shadows for depth.
Light background (#fafbfc or white).
Each stage has its own distinct accent color:
- Generate: Purple (#805ad5)
- Annotate: Cyan (#00b5d8)
- Screen: Amber (#ed8936)
- Decide: Green (#38a169)
No photorealism — clean, modern, tech diagram style.

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Stage names: Bold Sans-Serif, 36pt+
- Subtext/descriptions: Regular weight, 24pt+
- All text horizontal (no vertical or rotated text)

CONTENT TO VISUALIZE:
Synthyra's platform runs a generate-annotate-screen-decide workflow loop.
This is how the technology components work together to deliver value.

Four connected stages, flowing left to right:

[1] GENERATE (Purple #805ad5)
- Icon concept: DNA helix, sequence strand, or generation symbol
- Label: "GENERATE"
- Subtext: "100-1000 candidates"
- What happens: DSM engine creates candidate protein sequences optimized
  for desired properties. Starts with target or function, outputs variants.

→ Clean arrow connecting to next stage →

[2] ANNOTATE (Cyan #00b5d8)
- Icon concept: Tag, label, classification marker, or annotation symbol
- Label: "ANNOTATE"
- Subtext: "Function + pathways"
- What happens: CAMP engine adds functional annotation to each candidate.
  What does this protein do? Which pathways? What's the mechanism of action?
  Provides interpretable context, not just raw sequences.

→ Clean arrow connecting to next stage →

[3] SCREEN (Amber #ed8936)
- Icon concept: Grid matrix, radar sweep, or screening visualization
- Label: "SCREEN"
- Subtext: "Full proteome off-target map"
- What happens: Synteract Turbo screens every candidate against the entire
  human proteome. Outputs interaction probability, affinity scores, and
  binding sites for each candidate. This is where off-target risks surface.

→ Clean arrow connecting to next stage →

[4] DECIDE (Green #38a169)
- Icon concept: Checkmark in circle, gate, decision diamond, or go/no-go signal
- Label: "DECIDE"
- Subtext: "Go/no-go in seconds"
- What happens: Synteract 4 provides ultrafast decisioning at 375M interactions/sec.
  Which candidates are safe to advance? Which have red flags? Instant answers.

Arrows should feel like FLOW and PROGRESSION, not just static connectors.
Maybe subtle animation suggestion (gradient along arrow, or directional marks).

Overall feeling: "This is a systematic, integrated pipeline — not a collection
of one-off tools. Each stage feeds the next. The whole is greater than the parts."
