Create a vertical infographic showing why drug development fails.

SIZE & PLACEMENT:
- Output: 1000px wide × 1200px tall (will display at ~500×600px on slide)
- Placement: Right side of slide, replacing bullet list
- Text minimum 24pt at output size for readability at 50% scale

LAYOUT: Flowchart Nodes. Vertical funnel progression with 5 stages.
Clean alignment, ample negative space between stages.

STYLE: Flat vector art, modern biotech aesthetic.
Color palette: Cool grays (#f0f2f5, #4a5568) for background/structure,
red/coral (#e53e3e) for failures/eliminations, amber (#ed8936) for cost callouts.
White or very light gray background. No photorealism.

TYPOGRAPHY: Bold Sans-Serif headers at 36pt+, Helvetica-style labels at 24pt+.
All text must be legible when image displays at 500px wide.

CONTENT TO VISUALIZE:
Drug development is a brutal funnel where most candidates die and money burns.

Show a vertical funnel progression, narrowing from top to bottom:

TOP: "100 Compounds Enter Discovery" (wide opening, hopeful)
↓ Arrow down (show ~75 fading out or X'd in red)
"25 reach Preclinical"
↓ Arrow down (show ~15 eliminated)
"10 reach Phase I"
↓ Arrow down (show ~7 eliminated) — START showing cost accumulating here
"3 reach Phase II" — BIG CALLOUT with amber: "$50-100M spent by here"
↓ Arrow down (show 1-2 eliminated) — Show money/dollars burning
"1-2 reach Phase III"
↓ Arrow down
"Maybe 1 Approved" (tiny exit at bottom)

KEY VISUAL INSIGHT: The funnel narrows, but COST balloons.
Use visual weight/size to emphasize that Phase II/III is the "danger zone" where
most money is lost. Maybe show dollar signs accumulating on the right side,
getting larger as you go down.

The feeling should be: "This is why drug development is so expensive and risky —
we lose most candidates AFTER spending the most money."
