# Synthyra Strategy Validation Deck

## Purpose
Internal deck to align team on what we heard from the VC panel, surface the embedded assumptions, and define validation experiments before committing to strategy.

---

## Deck Structure

### 1. What We Heard
Panel verdict as input, not conclusion. "6-9 months from fundable" is their assessment — we need to test the assumptions behind it.

### 2. Key Hypotheses (Unvalidated)
| Hypothesis | Source | Risk if wrong |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| "Interrogation capacity" framing resonates | Panel pitch feedback | Waste positioning work |
| Safety & Tox is right wedge | Panel GTM rec | Build wrong case study, target wrong buyers |
| We beat Chai/AlphaFold on benchmarks | Competitive claim | Can't defend differentiation |
| $75K-$250K pilots are viable | Panel pricing | Price ourselves out or leave money on table |

### 3. Validation Experiments
| Experiment | Test | Signal | Timeline |
|------------|------|--------|----------|
| Positioning | Pitch both framings to 5 contacts | 3+ go to "how would this work?" | 2 weeks |
| Wedge Discovery | Discovery calls with 3 buyer types | One segment shows 2x urgency | 3 weeks |
| Benchmark | Run CASP, compare to competitors | Stat sig advantage on 2+ metrics | 8-12 weeks |
| Price Sensitivity | Test $50K/$100K/$200K in calls | 2+ don't flinch at $100K+ | 4 weeks |

### 4. Decision Points
Pre-commit to decisions based on experiment outcomes:
- **Positioning:** If resonates → commit. If not → test alternatives.
- **Wedge:** If Safety/Tox wins → focus GTM. If not → pivot to winning segment.
- **Benchmark:** If advantage → publish & use. If not → reposition to workflow value.
- **Pricing:** If $100K+ works → hold. If not → drop entry, add expansion.

### 5. First 30 Days Sprint
Week 1-2: Draft pitches, schedule 5 conversations, map buyer contacts
Week 2-4: Start benchmark, run 6+ discovery calls, build case study

### 6. Outcome
After 30 days: validated strategy we can commit to, or clear signal to pivot.

## Key Shift from V1
- **V1:** Presented panel recommendations as conclusions to execute
- **V2:** Presents panel input as hypotheses to validate before committing

The team's job isn't to check boxes. It's to run experiments and make informed decisions.
