# Brief

## Goals
- Introduce LightForge Works as an integrated business-software delivery team.
- Explain the inverted model: fixed time + fixed price with scope bounded by value.
- Define the SPA (Single Purpose Application) and how it integrates existing systems.
- Explain the 30/60/90 framework from discovery to ROI.
- Emphasize impact, value, and reduced delivery risk.

## Audience
- Prospective customers evaluating a software delivery partner.

## Narrative
- Multi-SaaS workflows break at handoffs and create manual work.
- LightForge Works flips the variables to protect time and cost.
- SPAs are production-grade micro-apps with fixed boundaries and integration-first design.
- 30/60/90 provides discovery, delivery, and ROI validation.

## Key proof points
- Fixed time + fixed price with boundary discipline.
- Integration over replacement with clear inputs/outputs.
- 30/60/90 framework with ROI validation by day 90.

## Must-include slides
- Who we are.
- The upside-down model.
- What the SPA is.
- Process overview.
- Impact/value.

## Risks / constraints
- Avoid price figures unless explicitly requested.
- Keep SPA vs micro-app terminology consistent across slides.
