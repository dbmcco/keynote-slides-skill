# Storytelling Best Practices for Slide Decks

## Core Principle: One Bold Idea Per Slide

Every slide should communicate a single, clear idea. If you need to explain multiple concepts, use multiple slides. Whitespace is your friend.

## Narrative Arc

Great presentations follow a story structure:

### 1. Hook (1-2 slides)
- Open with a provocative question, surprising fact, or bold statement
- Create tension or curiosity immediately
- Don't start with "About Us" or agenda

### 2. Problem/Tension (2-3 slides)
- Articulate the pain point clearly
- Make the audience feel the problem
- Use concrete examples, not abstractions
- "The cost of doing nothing"

### 3. Solution/Resolution (3-5 slides)
- Present your approach as the natural answer
- Show, don't just tell
- Use visuals to demonstrate concepts
- Build credibility with proof points

### 4. Proof/Evidence (2-4 slides)
- Metrics, case studies, testimonials
- Before/after comparisons
- Third-party validation
- "Here's what happens when..."

### 5. Call to Action (1-2 slides)
- One clear next step
- Make it easy to say yes
- Remove friction
- End with confidence, not apology

## Slide-Level Best Practices

### Headlines
- Write headlines as complete thoughts, not labels
- BAD: "Our Solution"
- GOOD: "Cut processing time by 60% with automated workflows"

### Visual Hierarchy
- Most important element gets the most space
- Eye should flow naturally: top-left → bottom-right (Western reading)
- Use size, color, and position to guide attention

### Text Guidelines
- Maximum 6 words per bullet (prefer fewer)
- Maximum 3-4 bullets per slide (prefer fewer)
- If you need more, you need more slides
- Never read your slides aloud

### Images & Diagrams
- Every image should earn its place
- Diagrams should simplify, not complicate
- Use consistent visual language throughout
- Infographics > stock photos

## Flow & Transitions

### Logical Connectors
Each slide should answer "So what?" from the previous slide:

```
Slide 1: "The market is shifting to AI-first solutions"
         ↓ (So what?)
Slide 2: "Companies without AI capabilities are losing 23% market share"
         ↓ (So what?)
Slide 3: "Your competitors are already investing heavily"
         ↓ (So what does this mean for me?)
Slide 4: "Here's how to catch up in 90 days"
```

### Transition Types
- **Buildup**: Each slide adds to a cumulative argument
- **Contrast**: Before/after, problem/solution, old/new
- **Sequence**: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3
- **Zoom**: Big picture → Details → Big picture

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Data Dump
- Too many numbers on one slide
- No hierarchy or emphasis
- FIX: One key metric per slide, context around it

### 2. The Wall of Text
- Paragraphs on slides
- Reading your slides to the audience
- FIX: Extract the headline, move details to notes

### 3. The Wandering Narrative
- Jumping between unrelated topics
- No clear throughline
- FIX: Outline first, each slide earns its place

### 4. The Weak Close
- Ending with Q&A slide or contact info
- No clear ask
- FIX: End with your strongest point and specific next step

### 5. The Buried Lead
- Most important point is slide 15
- Saving the best for last (but losing attention)
- FIX: Front-load your key message, then support it

## Integration with Claude Code

When building decks with Claude:

1. **Brief first**: Share context in `resources/materials/`
2. **Outline together**: Agree on narrative arc before slides
3. **Review iteratively**: Use Playwright screenshots to evaluate
4. **Check flow**: Ask Claude to review for logic and redundancy
5. **Refine language**: Headlines should be punchy and clear
